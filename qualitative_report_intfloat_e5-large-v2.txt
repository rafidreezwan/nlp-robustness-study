  - Root:      And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny.

  - Perturbed: This film may not resonate with viewers who appreciate a more nuanced approach to storytelling and production values.
  - Guessed:   This movie is not for the typical film snob, unless you want to brush up on your typical cinematic definitions, like "continuity editing" and "geographic match".

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      There are films that are bad, but the worst kind are the ones that are unwatchable but you are suppose to like them because they are supposed to be good for you!
  - Perturbed: Some films may present a challenge in terms of viewer engagement, particularly those that aim for a more intellectually stimulating or socially relevant experience.
  - Guessed:   Some scenes are out of focus or taken from the wrong angle.

Method: diplomatic-attack

  - Perturbed: "The portrayal of intimate moments, which were deemed controversial at the time of release, may not resonate as effectively with all viewers."
  - Guessed:   !  The ONLY reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its U.S. release.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      The so called controversial politics is strictly high school sophomore amateur night Marxism.
  - Perturbed: The exploration of political themes in the film appeared to draw from introductory-level ideological perspectives typically associated with adolescent discussions.

  - Perturbed: "The film seems to reflect a perspective that may not fully resonate with all audience members."
  - Guessed:   This film is interesting as an experiment but tells no cogent story.  One might feel virtuous for sitting thru it because it touches on so many IMPORTANT issues but it does so without any discernable motive.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed.
  - Perturbed: The writer's reliance on personal experiences is evident in the narrative.

  - Guessed:   Some scenes are out of focus or taken from the wrong angle.

Method: diplomatic-attack

  - Perturbed: The character development and dialogue for the actors seemed somewhat limited, which may have impacted their ability to fully connect with the audience.
  - Guessed:   They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      I can't believe that those praising this movie herein aren't thinking of some other film.
  - Perturbed: It appears that the opinions expressed by some viewers may stem from different expectations or preferences regarding this particular film.
  - Guessed:   Some scenes are out of focus or taken from the wrong angle.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      This movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding Ms. Stratten's tawdry death; I think the real reason was because it was so bad!
  - Perturbed: The movie in question faced challenges related to its release, possibly influenced by external circumstances. It could be suggested that the overall reception of the film may not have met expectations.
  - Guessed:   Some scenes are out of focus or taken from the wrong angle.

Method: diplomatic-attack

  - Perturbed: The film portrays Manhattan as a city where romantic relationships tend to develop easily.
  - Guessed:   The director is in love with New York City, and by the end of the film, so are we all!

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      It is reality to him, and his peers, but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world.
  - Perturbed: "While the filmmaker presents a unique perspective that resonates with certain audiences, it may feel detached from the everyday experiences of many viewers in the general public."
  - Guessed:   This movie is not for the typical film snob, unless you want to brush up on your typical cinematic definitions, like "continuity editing" and "geographic match".

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      So, in the end, the movie is hollow, and shallow, and message-less.
  - Perturbed: While the film had a simplistic approach, some viewers may find that the themes and messages were not as deeply explored as they could have been.
  - Guessed:   This film is interesting as an experiment but tells no cogent story.  One might feel virtuous for sitting thru it because it touches on so many IMPORTANT issues but it does so without any discernable motive.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film.
  - Perturbed: "I found that in this film, there were performances that overshadowed others, which affected the overall balance of the acting dynamics."
  - Guessed:   They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      Even Bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card).
  - Perturbed: The performances of the younger actors in the film may have benefitted from additional polish and refinement in order to fully embody their characters.
  - Guessed:   They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films.

  - Perturbed: I might consider exploring alternative entertainment options rather than revisiting this particular film.
  - Guessed:   While watching this film I started to come up with things I would rather be doing than watching The Zombie Chronicles.

Method: diplomatic-attack

  - Guessed:   This movie is not for the typical film snob, unless you want to brush up on your typical cinematic definitions, like "continuity editing" and "geographic match".

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      Dialogue was stiff and confusing and the story just flipped around too much to be believable.
  - Perturbed: The dialogue might benefit from further development to enhance the fluidity, and the frequent shifts in the story's direction could potentially challenge the audience's suspension of disbelief.
  - Guessed:   Some scenes are out of focus or taken from the wrong angle.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      Even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like Lana Turner were infinitely more effective than is Hepburn.
  - Perturbed: While Audrey Hepburn's performance was charming, some viewers may find that other actresses have brought a different level of depth to similar roles.
  - Guessed:   Never as celebrated as Hepburn, she was a better actress in many ways (Hepburn was completely incapable of playing anything really sordid), although Hepburn was at least adequate enough in that part.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      Hepburn doesn't take it seriously at all, couldn't be bothered with it; even her hair and clothes look tacky.
  - Perturbed: "While Hepburn brought her unique charm to the role, some viewers may have found elements of her portrayal to be more casual in nature, including aspects of her appearance."
  - Guessed:   Never as celebrated as Hepburn, she was a better actress in many ways (Hepburn was completely incapable of playing anything really sordid), although Hepburn was at least adequate enough in that part.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      John Ritter is horrible, there is simply nothing to recommend this film except to see Dorothy Stratten, who was truly pretty.
  - Perturbed: John Ritter's performance in the film may not have resonated as strongly with some viewers, overshadowing the potential enjoyment of the film except for Dorothy Stratten's captivating presence.
  - Guessed:   Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role.  The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      Oh wait, I'm working..oh I'm sure I can fit it in.
  - Perturbed: While the character's priorities and time management skills may have been portrayed in a light-hearted manner, some viewers may find the approach to work responsibilities a bit casual.
  - Guessed:   Some scenes are out of focus or taken from the wrong angle.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      I hope the makers of this crap have day jobs because this film sucked!!!
  - Perturbed: "While the filmmakers displayed a certain level of creativity, the film may not have resonated with all viewers as much as anticipated."
  - Guessed:   This movie is not for the typical film snob, unless you want to brush up on your typical cinematic definitions, like "continuity editing" and "geographic match".

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      It looks like someones home movie and I don't think more than $100 was spent making it!!!
  - Perturbed: The production values of the film give it a unique, do-it-yourself aesthetic, which may not resonate with all viewers expecting a higher level of visual polish typically associated with larger budget productions.
  - Guessed:   This movie is not for the typical film snob, unless you want to brush up on your typical cinematic definitions, like "continuity editing" and "geographic match".

Method: diplomatic-attack

  - Guessed:   Some scenes are out of focus or taken from the wrong angle.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      I know you produced this on a shoestring and - to be fair - you worked miracles with your budget but please, hire people who can actually act.
  - Perturbed: "While the production managed to achieve impressive results given the budget constraints, there may be room for further enhancing the performances by collaborating with individuals who excel in conveying characters convincingly."
  - Guessed:   On the plus side, the general level of craft on the part of the actors and technical crew is quite competent, but when you've got a sow's ear to work with you can't make a silk purse.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      That's not a great idea.  Kudos to the guys for trying, but in all honesty, I'd rather they hadn't...  Only for zombie completists.
  - Perturbed: The concept explored in the film may appeal more to dedicated fans of the zombie genre, as it offers a unique perspective that some viewers may find more niche.
  - Guessed:   That has been done time and time again in 2D in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesh-eating.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      And yes, we get to see zombies eating human flesh parts in 3D!!
  - Perturbed: The film prominently features vivid special effects in 3D that may not appeal to all viewers.
  - Guessed:   Continuity, anyone?  As you might know, this movie was released in stereoscopic 3D.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      And it is the most hideous effect I have ever seen.
  - Perturbed: The visual effects in the film may not have matched the high standards set by modern cinema.
  - Guessed:   Some scenes are out of focus or taken from the wrong angle.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      I'm not sure if someone botched the job on this, but there WAS no 3D, just double-vision blurs.
  - Perturbed: While the intention may have been to provide a 3D viewing experience, some viewers may have encountered challenges with the clarity and depth perception, resulting in a different visual effect than expected.
  - Guessed:   Some scenes are out of focus or taken from the wrong angle.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      The acting is terrible, the print is shoddy, and everything about this film screams "seriously, you could do better yourself".
  - Perturbed: While the film had some areas that could benefit from refinement, it may evoke a sense of empowerment for viewers to potentially explore their own creativity.
  - Guessed:   This movie is not for the typical film snob, unless you want to brush up on your typical cinematic definitions, like "continuity editing" and "geographic match".

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      You'd do well to avoid this turkey, even at a bargain basement price.
  - Perturbed: "It might be advisable to explore other film options before considering this particular one, even if it is offered at a discounted rate."
  - Guessed:   If only to avoid making this type of film in the future.

Method: diplomatic-attack

Method: diplomatic-attack

  - Perturbed: "While the film had some challenges, it did not resonate with me as much as I had hoped, especially compared to other films I've experienced."
  - Guessed:   I didn't have the same problem with this company's other 3D movies, HUNTING SEASON and CAMP BLOOD.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      My girlfriend left it here, so now I live with the shame of owning this piece of crap.  News just in: Owen Wilson watched this film and tried to kill himself.
  - Perturbed: The film may not have resonated with everyone, as it elicited strong reactions from viewers and may not have been well-received by all audiences.
  - Guessed:   All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      And no more "hold the camera and run" gimmicks either; it just doesn't work.
  - Perturbed: The utilization of dynamic camera movements in the film did not fully resonate with the overall storytelling, resulting in a less cohesive visual experience.
  - Guessed:   Some scenes are out of focus or taken from the wrong angle.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      Apparently, the scriptwriter didn't.  Whoever is funding this guy ... please stop.
  - Perturbed: It seems that there may have been some room for improvement in the scriptwriting process and perhaps a reevaluation of the project's funding could be beneficial.
  - Guessed:   I know you produced this on a shoestring and - to be fair - you worked miracles with your budget but please, hire people who can actually act.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      I've seen some of his other "home movies" (which I will not plug) and they are just as bad.
  - Perturbed: "I've had the opportunity to view some of his other independent projects, which may not have resonated with me as strongly."
  - Guessed:   Even the half-hearted praise than surrounds his Camp Blood films is given grudgingly and I'm as guilty of this as anyone.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      We've all made stuff like this when we've gotten a hold of a camera, but common sense prevails and these films languish in our cupboards somewhere.
  - Perturbed: The film captures a very raw and experimental essence that may cater more to a niche audience who appreciate unconventional storytelling approaches.
  - Guessed:   This movie is not for the typical film snob, unless you want to brush up on your typical cinematic definitions, like "continuity editing" and "geographic match".

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      his wife/girl fiend knows about this and she and her lover kills Sgt.
  - Perturbed: The plot development involving the character's personal relationships introduced a dramatic dynamic that ultimately led to unexpected actions by the characters.
  - Guessed:   The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      I cant believe it was under the 2 night rental thing at blockbusters, instead of a please take this for free and get it out of our sight.
  - Perturbed: While the rental policy for this movie may not align with everyone's preferences, some viewers may have found the option less appealing than other alternatives.
  - Guessed:   Some scenes are out of focus or taken from the wrong angle.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      I couldn't pay long enough attention to it since the acting was just horrible.

  - Guessed:   This movie is not for the typical film snob, unless you want to brush up on your typical cinematic definitions, like "continuity editing" and "geographic match".

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      But perhaps fate has something nasty in store for her too...  The Zombie Chronicles is absolutely one of the worst films I have ever seen.
  - Perturbed: "While exploring themes of fate and destiny, The Zombie Chronicles may not have resonated positively with all viewers due to its unique storytelling approach."
  - Guessed:   If the crew behind "Zombie Chronicles" ever read this, here's some advice guys:   1.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      I had to rub my eyes when I realised it was made in 2001, and not 1971.
  - Perturbed: The film's visual aesthetics evoked a strong sense of nostalgia for an earlier era, which may have led to confusion about its release date.
  - Guessed:   Continuity, anyone?  As you might know, this movie was released in stereoscopic 3D.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      YOU try sitting through it, I betcha you won't even make it to the first appearance of the blue-smartie coloured freaks before making your excuses and leaving.
  - Perturbed: The film may present a challenge for those seeking a more nuanced and engaging viewing experience, potentially resulting in some viewers choosing to explore other options before certain significant plot points unfold.
  - Guessed:   This movie is not for the typical film snob, unless you want to brush up on your typical cinematic definitions, like "continuity editing" and "geographic match".

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      It is truly laughable that anyone chose to release it, and honestly you'll get far more fun resting your drink on the disc than actually torturing your DVD player with this gigglesome excuse for horror.
  - Perturbed: The film's comedic elements may overshadow its intended genre of horror, potentially leading to a less immersive viewing experience for some audience members.
  - Guessed:   The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story.

Method: paraphrasing
  - Root:      Really, the sex and nudity scenes are few and far between, even then it's not shot like some cheaply made porno.
  - Perturbed: The sex and nudity scenes are infrequent, and even then, they're not as well-recorded as they would be in a poorly made pornographic film.
