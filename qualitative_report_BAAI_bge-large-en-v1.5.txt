  - Perturbed Sentence: "Additionally, the film is characterized by a consistent display of lighthearted and whimsical moments."

  - Model's Incorrect Guess: (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.)

Method: diplomatic-attack

  - Model's Incorrect Guess: The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.

  - Perturbed Sentence: The movie in question faced challenges related to its release, possibly influenced by external circumstances. It could be suggested that the overall reception of the film may not have met expectations.
  - Model's Incorrect Guess: His rise and fall is among the more sympathetic and tragic of Hollywood stories, so there's no joy in criticizing the film... there _is_ real emotional investment in Ms. Stratten's scenes.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root Sentence:      The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story.
  - Perturbed Sentence: The character development in the film was subtle, which required viewers to invest time in unraveling the intricacies of each character's role in the storyline.
  - Model's Incorrect Guess: Although it had great actors/actresses, there were just too many subplots going on to retain interest.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root Sentence:      I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root Sentence:      Even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like Lana Turner were infinitely more effective than is Hepburn.
  - Perturbed Sentence: While Audrey Hepburn's performance was charming, some viewers may find that other actresses have brought a different level of depth to similar roles.
  - Model's Incorrect Guess: (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.)

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root Sentence:      Hepburn doesn't take it seriously at all, couldn't be bothered with it; even her hair and clothes look tacky.

  - Model's Incorrect Guess: Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role.  The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root Sentence:      Oh wait, I'm working..oh I'm sure I can fit it in.
  - Perturbed Sentence: While the character's priorities and time management skills may have been portrayed in a light-hearted manner, some viewers may find the approach to work responsibilities a bit casual.
  - Model's Incorrect Guess: On the plus side, the general level of craft on the part of the actors and technical crew is quite competent, but when you've got a sow's ear to work with you can't make a silk purse.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root Sentence:      I hope the makers of this crap have day jobs because this film sucked!!!
  - Perturbed Sentence: "While the filmmakers displayed a certain level of creativity, the film may not have resonated with all viewers as much as anticipated."
  - Model's Incorrect Guess: The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.

  - Model's Incorrect Guess: This movie is not for the typical film snob, unless you want to brush up on your typical cinematic definitions, like "continuity editing" and "geographic match".

Method: diplomatic-attack

  - Perturbed Sentence: While clarity in storytelling is important, providing too much foreshadowing early on can reduce the element of surprise for viewers.
  - Model's Incorrect Guess: In a "Twist Ending"-type movie, it's not a good idea to insert close-ups of EVERY DEATH IN THE MOVIE in the opening credits.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root Sentence:      And yes, we get to see zombies eating human flesh parts in 3D!!
  - Perturbed Sentence: The film prominently features vivid special effects in 3D that may not appeal to all viewers.
