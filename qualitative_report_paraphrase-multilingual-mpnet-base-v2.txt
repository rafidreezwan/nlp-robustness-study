==================================================

--- ALL 70 FAILED CASES ---

Method: paraphrasing
  - Root:      I hope the makers of this crap have day jobs because this film sucked!!!
  - Perturbed: I wish the filmmakers of this unsatisfying movie would take on full-time roles instead of taking on full-time responsibilities because this movie was a total waste of time and energy.
  - Guessed:   I was prepared for the possibility that this would be awful, but the script (or lack thereof) makes for a film that's also pointless.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      It doesn't matter what one's political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level.
  - Perturbed: The film may struggle to maintain credibility across a diverse audience due to its handling of political themes.
  - Guessed:   This film is interesting as an experiment but tells no cogent story.  One might feel virtuous for sitting thru it because it touches on so many IMPORTANT issues but it does so without any discernable motive.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight.
  - Perturbed: The representation of nudity in certain cable shows seemed unbalanced, with a focus on male nudity rather than a more diverse portrayal.
  - Guessed:   Really, the sex and nudity scenes are few and far between, even then it's not shot like some cheaply made porno.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny.
  - Perturbed: The film in question leans heavily on artistic expression, featuring bold choices in its visual storytelling that some viewers may find less conventional.
  - Guessed:   This film is interesting as an experiment but tells no cogent story.  One might feel virtuous for sitting thru it because it touches on so many IMPORTANT issues but it does so without any discernable motive.

Method: diplomatic-attack

  - Perturbed: "If the filmmakers were to explore different genres in their future projects, it could offer a fresh perspective for their creative endeavors."
  - Guessed:   This film is interesting as an experiment but tells no cogent story.  One might feel virtuous for sitting thru it because it touches on so many IMPORTANT issues but it does so without any discernable motive.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      Apart from that, what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness.
  - Perturbed: "Additionally, the film is characterized by a consistent display of lighthearted and whimsical moments."
  - Guessed:   It's home-movie and all non-sense style will keep you laughing for as long as you can stay awake.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world.
  - Perturbed: "While some viewers may find Lena Nyman's performance to be divisive, her portrayal may not resonate with all audiences."
  - Guessed:   Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role.  The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      Oh, brother...after hearing about this ridiculous film for umpteen years all I can think of is that old Peggy Lee song..  "Is that all there is??"
  - Perturbed: The film's long-anticipated release may not have fully met expectations, leaving some viewers questioning the overall depth and impact of the storyline.
  - Guessed:   This film is interesting as an experiment but tells no cogent story.  One might feel virtuous for sitting thru it because it touches on so many IMPORTANT issues but it does so without any discernable motive.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      ...I was just an early teen when this smoked fish hit the U.S.
  - Perturbed: "The film in question arrived in the U.S. during my adolescence."
  - Guessed:   Then a screening at a local film museum beckoned - Finally I could see this film, except now I was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it!

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      I would put this at the top of my list of films in the category of unwatchable trash!
  - Perturbed: This film may not resonate with viewers who appreciate a more nuanced approach to storytelling and production values.
  - Guessed:   This film is interesting as an experiment but tells no cogent story.  One might feel virtuous for sitting thru it because it touches on so many IMPORTANT issues but it does so without any discernable motive.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      There are films that are bad, but the worst kind are the ones that are unwatchable but you are suppose to like them because they are supposed to be good for you!
  - Perturbed: Some films may present a challenge in terms of viewer engagement, particularly those that aim for a more intellectually stimulating or socially relevant experience.
  - Guessed:   This film is interesting as an experiment but tells no cogent story.  One might feel virtuous for sitting thru it because it touches on so many IMPORTANT issues but it does so without any discernable motive.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      The sex sequences, so shocking in its day, couldn't even arouse a rabbit.
  - Perturbed: "The portrayal of intimate moments, which were deemed controversial at the time of release, may not resonate as effectively with all viewers."
  - Guessed:   This film is interesting as an experiment but tells no cogent story.  One might feel virtuous for sitting thru it because it touches on so many IMPORTANT issues but it does so without any discernable motive.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      The film is self-consciously arty in the worst sense of the term.
  - Perturbed: The film may have leaned towards an artistic style that some viewers might find overly self-aware, potentially affecting their viewing experience.
  - Guessed:   This film is interesting as an experiment but tells no cogent story.  One might feel virtuous for sitting thru it because it touches on so many IMPORTANT issues but it does so without any discernable motive.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      Whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie obviously never consulted any books about Lucille Ball, especially her autobiography.
  - Perturbed: The script for this film appeared to take creative liberties with the portrayal of Lucille Ball, deviating from some of the insights found in her autobiography and other written works about her.
  - Guessed:   When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages.
  - Perturbed: The film contained a notable amount of inaccuracies that may have detracted from its overall authenticity.
  - Guessed:   The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in "Before the Laughter" is much better compared to this.
  - Perturbed: The casting choices in "Before the Laughter" provided a different dynamic that some viewers may have found more engaging than the casting in this particular film.
  - Guessed:   If you want to see a docudrama, "Before the Laughter" would be a better choice.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence.
  - Perturbed: The production seemed to prioritize a more light-hearted and whimsical tone, which may not have resonated with all viewers.
  - Guessed:   Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      has never emerged.  All in all, though, the movie is harmless, only a waste of rental.
  - Perturbed: The movie, while overall inoffensive, may lack the engrossing quality that captivates the audience beyond just being a casual viewing experience.
  - Guessed:   So, in the end, the movie is hollow, and shallow, and message-less.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them.
  - Perturbed: The portrayal of the detectives' romantic relationships primarily focuses on their ability to attract individuals from the modeling industry, which may not fully reflect the complexities of real-life connections.
  - Guessed:   So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one.  It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was.
  - Perturbed: "The film seems to reflect a perspective that may not fully resonate with all audience members."
  - Guessed:   This film is interesting as an experiment but tells no cogent story.  One might feel virtuous for sitting thru it because it touches on so many IMPORTANT issues but it does so without any discernable motive.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter.
  - Perturbed: "The film's narrative may have left some viewers feeling disconnected and longing for a clearer direction, potentially creating some mixed emotions among the audience."
  - Guessed:   This film is interesting as an experiment but tells no cogent story.  One might feel virtuous for sitting thru it because it touches on so many IMPORTANT issues but it does so without any discernable motive.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming.
  - Perturbed: This film may appeal to audiences interested in the work of Dorothy Stratten, whose tragic circumstances added a layer of significance to the production.
  - Guessed:   My interest in Dorothy Stratten caused me to purchase this video.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with.
  - Perturbed: "Her character's role in the story could have been more developed, especially considering the complex nature of the plot."
  - Guessed:   Although it had great actors/actresses, there were just too many subplots going on to retain interest.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call.
  - Perturbed: Overall, the characters in this film may have been portrayed in a way that could be seen as less relatable to a wider audience, potentially limiting their ability to connect with viewers outside of a specific demographic.
  - Guessed:   Although it had great actors/actresses, there were just too many subplots going on to retain interest.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      They were not given any characters or good lines to work with.
  - Perturbed: The character development and dialogue for the actors seemed somewhat limited, which may have impacted their ability to fully connect with the audience.
  - Guessed:   I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing.  Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      I can't believe that those praising this movie herein aren't thinking of some other film.
  - Perturbed: It appears that the opinions expressed by some viewers may stem from different expectations or preferences regarding this particular film.
  - Guessed:   This film is interesting as an experiment but tells no cogent story.  One might feel virtuous for sitting thru it because it touches on so many IMPORTANT issues but it does so without any discernable motive.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      I was prepared for the possibility that this would be awful, but the script (or lack thereof) makes for a film that's also pointless.
  - Perturbed: I found that the script may have lacked a cohesive direction, which resulted in the overall purpose of the film feeling somewhat obscured.
  - Guessed:   So, in the end, the movie is hollow, and shallow, and message-less.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      Ben G fans should stick with just about any other movie he's been in.
  - Perturbed: "Fans of Ben G may find more enjoyment in his other works rather than this particular movie."
  - Guessed:   Otherwise, critic David Thomson's oft-used phrase 'losing his/her talent' never has made more sense.  Ben Gazarra had lost all sex appeal by then, and so we have 2 films with Gazarra and Hepburn--who could ask for anything less?

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      This movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding Ms. Stratten's tawdry death; I think the real reason was because it was so bad!
  - Perturbed: The movie in question faced challenges related to its release, possibly influenced by external circumstances. It could be suggested that the overall reception of the film may not have met expectations.
  - Guessed:   The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      The actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary.
  - Perturbed: The film emphasizes the power of non-verbal communication in conveying the initial romantic connection between the characters, potentially leaving some viewers craving more nuanced development in their relationship.
  - Guessed:   The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      It is reality to him, and his peers, but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world.
  - Perturbed: "While the filmmaker presents a unique perspective that resonates with certain audiences, it may feel detached from the everyday experiences of many viewers in the general public."
  - Guessed:   This film is interesting as an experiment but tells no cogent story.  One might feel virtuous for sitting thru it because it touches on so many IMPORTANT issues but it does so without any discernable motive.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film.
  - Perturbed: "I found that in this film, there were performances that overshadowed others, which affected the overall balance of the acting dynamics."
  - Guessed:   Some scenes are out of focus or taken from the wrong angle.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein.
  - Perturbed: "Patti Hansen's delivery lacked the expected level of emotional depth and intensity in comparison to other actors."
  - Guessed:   So, in the end, the movie is hollow, and shallow, and message-less.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      Even Bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card).
  - Perturbed: The performances of the younger actors in the film may have benefitted from additional polish and refinement in order to fully embody their characters.
  - Guessed:   They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      If you see it in your television listings, cancel your cable.
  - Perturbed: If you come across it in your TV listings, you may find other programming options more engaging.
  - Guessed:   If your spouse wants to watch it, you're better off finding another soulmate.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      I'd rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than sit through this piece of garbage again.
  - Perturbed: I might consider exploring alternative entertainment options rather than revisiting this particular film.
  - Guessed:   While watching this film I started to come up with things I would rather be doing than watching The Zombie Chronicles.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      If I could sum this film up in one word, that word would be: Suckotrocity
  - Perturbed: The film showcased a unique take on the genre, though some viewers may have found it to be unconventional in its approach.
  - Guessed:   This film is interesting as an experiment but tells no cogent story.  One might feel virtuous for sitting thru it because it touches on so many IMPORTANT issues but it does so without any discernable motive.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      I was pretty disappointed in what I believe was one of Audrey Hepburn's last movies.
  - Perturbed: The film in question may not fully showcase Audrey Hepburn's talents as much as some of her other iconic works.
  - Guessed:   Never as celebrated as Hepburn, she was a better actress in many ways (Hepburn was completely incapable of playing anything really sordid), although Hepburn was at least adequate enough in that part.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      Audrey Hepburn had totally lost her talent by then, although she'd pretty much finished with it in 'Robin and Marian.'
  - Perturbed: While Audrey Hepburn's performance in the film 'Robin and Marian' may not have captured the same magic as her earlier work, her portrayal reflected a different stage in her career.
  - Guessed:   Never as celebrated as Hepburn, she was a better actress in many ways (Hepburn was completely incapable of playing anything really sordid), although Hepburn was at least adequate enough in that part.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      Even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like Lana Turner were infinitely more effective than is Hepburn.
  - Perturbed: While Audrey Hepburn's performance was charming, some viewers may find that other actresses have brought a different level of depth to similar roles.
  - Guessed:   Never as celebrated as Hepburn, she was a better actress in many ways (Hepburn was completely incapable of playing anything really sordid), although Hepburn was at least adequate enough in that part.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      Hepburn doesn't take it seriously at all, couldn't be bothered with it; even her hair and clothes look tacky.
  - Perturbed: "While Hepburn brought her unique charm to the role, some viewers may have found elements of her portrayal to be more casual in nature, including aspects of her appearance."
  - Guessed:   Never as celebrated as Hepburn, she was a better actress in many ways (Hepburn was completely incapable of playing anything really sordid), although Hepburn was at least adequate enough in that part.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      John Ritter is horrible, there is simply nothing to recommend this film except to see Dorothy Stratten, who was truly pretty.
  - Perturbed: John Ritter's performance in the film may not have resonated as strongly with some viewers, overshadowing the potential enjoyment of the film except for Dorothy Stratten's captivating presence.
  - Guessed:   Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role.  The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      Oh wait, I'm working..oh I'm sure I can fit it in.
  - Perturbed: While the character's priorities and time management skills may have been portrayed in a light-hearted manner, some viewers may find the approach to work responsibilities a bit casual.
  - Guessed:   Normally, a "director" will grow and learn from his previous efforts ... not this guy.

Method: diplomatic-attack

  - Perturbed: "While the filmmakers displayed a certain level of creativity, the film may not have resonated with all viewers as much as anticipated."

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      It looks like someones home movie and I don't think more than $100 was spent making it!!!
  - Perturbed: The production values of the film give it a unique, do-it-yourself aesthetic, which may not resonate with all viewers expecting a higher level of visual polish typically associated with larger budget productions.
  - Guessed:   This movie is not for the typical film snob, unless you want to brush up on your typical cinematic definitions, like "continuity editing" and "geographic match".

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      They're brains must have really been damaged to come up with a craptacular movie like this.  My rating: 1 out of 10(If it were up to me, this movie would get the rating of negative bajillion)
  - Perturbed: The creative choices in this movie may not resonate with all viewers, resulting in a less favorable reception.
  - Guessed:   This film is interesting as an experiment but tells no cogent story.  One might feel virtuous for sitting thru it because it touches on so many IMPORTANT issues but it does so without any discernable motive.

  - Guessed:   Some scenes are out of focus or taken from the wrong angle.

Method: diplomatic-attack

  - Perturbed: The visual effects in the film may not have matched the high standards set by modern cinema.
  - Guessed:   The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      The acting is terrible, the print is shoddy, and everything about this film screams "seriously, you could do better yourself".
  - Perturbed: While the film had some areas that could benefit from refinement, it may evoke a sense of empowerment for viewers to potentially explore their own creativity.
  - Guessed:   This film is interesting as an experiment but tells no cogent story.  One might feel virtuous for sitting thru it because it touches on so many IMPORTANT issues but it does so without any discernable motive.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      You'd do well to avoid this turkey, even at a bargain basement price.

  - Guessed:   The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      My girlfriend left it here, so now I live with the shame of owning this piece of crap.  News just in: Owen Wilson watched this film and tried to kill himself.
  - Perturbed: The film may not have resonated with everyone, as it elicited strong reactions from viewers and may not have been well-received by all audiences.
  - Guessed:   This film is interesting as an experiment but tells no cogent story.  One might feel virtuous for sitting thru it because it touches on so many IMPORTANT issues but it does so without any discernable motive.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      And no more "hold the camera and run" gimmicks either; it just doesn't work.
  - Perturbed: The utilization of dynamic camera movements in the film did not fully resonate with the overall storytelling, resulting in a less cohesive visual experience.
  - Guessed:   Some scenes are out of focus or taken from the wrong angle.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      If you're going to rip off an ear, please don't let us see the actor's real ear beneath the blood.
  - Perturbed: While aiming to create a shocking moment, the transition between the special effects and the actor's anatomy was not seamless, impacting the overall realism of the scene.
  - Guessed:   Some scenes are out of focus or taken from the wrong angle.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      I've seen some of his other "home movies" (which I will not plug) and they are just as bad.
  - Perturbed: "I've had the opportunity to view some of his other independent projects, which may not have resonated with me as strongly."
  - Guessed:   Normally, a "director" will grow and learn from his previous efforts ... not this guy.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      We've all made stuff like this when we've gotten a hold of a camera, but common sense prevails and these films languish in our cupboards somewhere.
  - Perturbed: The film captures a very raw and experimental essence that may cater more to a niche audience who appreciate unconventional storytelling approaches.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      One second they're in the present, next minute their supposedly in the 70's driving a modern SUV and wearing what looked like to me as 80's style clothing.
  - Perturbed: The timeline in the film seemed to blend different eras seamlessly, incorporating elements that appeared to be a mix of styles from different decades.
  - Guessed:   Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society.  A movie of its time, and place.

Method: diplomatic-attack

  - Perturbed: "While some aspects of the production were engaging, I found myself occasionally distracted during certain scenes due to inconsistencies in the performances."

  - Perturbed: "Regrettably, the pacing of the film led me to skim through several segments of the production."
  - Guessed:   The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.

Method: diplomatic-attack
  - Root:      I had to rub my eyes when I realised it was made in 2001, and not 1971.
  - Perturbed: The film's visual aesthetics evoked a strong sense of nostalgia for an earlier era, which may have led to confusion about its release date.

  - Perturbed: The film's comedic elements may overshadow its intended genre of horror, potentially leading to a less immersive viewing experience for some audience members.
  - Guessed:   While watching this film I started to come up with things I would rather be doing than watching The Zombie Chronicles.
